# MPV Playback Position Storage Configuration

# To store the playback position when quitting, you can use the following options:
# - quit-watch-later (default: Shift+Q keybinding)
# - write-watch-later-config
# - --save-position-on-quit option

# The difference between quit-watch-later and --save-position-on-quit is as follows:
# - quit-watch-later is bound to a keybinding and is used to quit MPV while saving the playback position.
# - --save-position-on-quit is an option that saves the playback position even when MPV is closed without using the quit-watch-later keybinding.
#   It ensures that the playback position is saved even when MPV is closed with methods other than keybindings, such as system shutdown.

# Note: If MPV is terminated abruptly (e.g., with the KILL Unix signal), it may not have the time to save the playback position.

# Example Configuration:
# Uncomment and customize the following lines in your mpv.conf file:

# quit-watch-later
# write-watch-later-config
# --save-position-on-quit

# Additional Options:
# You can customize which options are saved with the --watch-later-options option.

# Example:
# --watch-later-options=volume,audio-delay,sub-delay

# Disable automatic aspect ratio adjustment for the window
# This setting allows freely resizing the MPV window without maintaining the original video's aspect ratio.

# Whether the video window is maximized or not.
# Set this option to 'yes' to maximize the video window, or 'no' to unmaximize it.
# This setting is applicable if the current Video Output (VO) supports window maximization.
--window-maximized=no

# Set the initial window size to a fixed width and height (1280x720 pixels)
geometry=1280x720

# Scale the window proportionally to the video resolution (1.0 = 100% of the video's size)
# NOTE: If geometry is set, this option is generally unnecessary but can be a fallback
# for cases where you resize or reset the window.

# Control whether the X11 compositor bypass is enabled or disabled.
# Set to 'no' to disable bypassing the X11 compositor, allowing it to handle video rendering.
