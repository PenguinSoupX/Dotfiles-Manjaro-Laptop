# MPV Playback Position Storage Configuration

# To store the playback position when quitting, you can use the following options:
# - quit-watch-later (default: Shift+Q keybinding)
# - write-watch-later-config
# - --save-position-on-quit option

# The difference between quit-watch-later and --save-position-on-quit is as follows:
# - quit-watch-later is bound to a keybinding and is used to quit MPV while saving the playback position.
# - --save-position-on-quit is an option that saves the playback position even when MPV is closed without using the quit-watch-later keybinding.
#   It ensures that the playback position is saved even when MPV is closed with methods other than keybindings, such as system shutdown.

# Note: If MPV is terminated abruptly (e.g., with the KILL Unix signal), it may not have the time to save the playback position.

# Example Configuration:
# Uncomment and customize the following lines in your mpv.conf file:

quit-watch-later
# write-watch-later-config
# --save-position-on-quit

# Additional Options:
# You can customize which options are saved with the --watch-later-options option.

# Example:
# --watch-later-options=volume,audio-delay,sub-delay

# Disable automatic aspect ratio adjustment for the window
# This setting allows freely resizing the MPV window without maintaining the original video's aspect ratio.
no-keepaspect-window

# Whether the video window is maximized or not.
# Set this option to 'yes' to maximize the video window, or 'no' to unmaximize it.
# This setting is applicable if the current Video Output (VO) supports window maximization.
--window-maximized=yes

 # Control whether the X11 compositor bypass is enabled or disabled.
# Set to 'no' to disable bypassing the X11 compositor, allowing it to handle video rendering.
# This option may affect video playback performance and compatibility with certain compositors.
x11-bypass-compositor=no


# Set the video decoder and post-processing profile to "gpu-hq"
# This is a high-quality profile optimized for GPU-accelerated decoding and post-processing
profile=gpu-hq

# Specify the graphics API to use for GPU acceleration
# Vulkan is a low-level graphics API that provides high-performance access to the GPU
gpu-api=vulkan

# Set the scaling algorithm to "ewa_lanczossharp"
# This is a high-quality scaling algorithm that uses elliptical weighted average filtering and Lanczos resampling
# to produce sharp, detailed images
scale=ewa_lanczossharp

# Set the chroma scaling algorithm to "ewa_lanczossharp"
# This is the same algorithm used for the luminance scaling
cscale=ewa_lanczossharp

# Set the downscaling algorithm to "mitchell"
# This is a high-quality algorithm that produces smooth, detailed images
dscale=mitchell

# Enable frame interpolation
# This generates new frames between existing frames to smooth out motion and reduce judder
interpolation

# Set the temporal scaling algorithm to "catmull_rom"
# This is a high-quality algorithm that generates smooth, detailed motion between frames
tscale=catmull_rom

# Set the video synchronization method to "display-resample"
# This resamples the video to match the display refresh rate and eliminates judder and tearing
video-sync=display-resample

# Set the anti-ringing filter strength to 0.5
# This reduces the artifacts that can occur during image scaling
scale-antiring=0.5
