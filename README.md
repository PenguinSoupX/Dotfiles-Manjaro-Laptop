My Dot Files
============

This is a collection of dot files that I use on my Linux machine. These files contain my personal configurations for various applications and utilities, such as my shell (bash) and text editor (Vim).

Installation
------------

To use these dot files on your own machine, follow these steps:

1.  Clone this repository to your home directory:


    `git clone https://github.com/PenguinSoupX/Dotfiles-Laptop.git ~/dotfiles`

2.  Copy the contents of the `dotfiles` directory to your home directory:


    `cp -r ~/dotfiles/* ~/`

This will copy all the dot files to your home directory and maintain the same folder structure.

Usage
-----

These dot files contain my personal configurations, but you can modify them to suit your own preferences. The dot files are organized into directories based on the application or utility that they configure. For example, the `bash` directory contains my configuration for the Bash shell, and the `vim` directory contains my configuration for Vim.

To make changes to these dot files, edit the files in your home directory that correspond to the dot files in the repository. For example, to modify my Vim configuration, edit the `~/.vimrc` file.
